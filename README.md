# OpenGOAL Launcher

[![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/opengoal-launcher/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/opengoal-launcher)

Our attempt at distributing the [OpenGOAL](https://github.com/open-goal/jak-project) releases in a cross-platform and easy to use and update way. It also is a place for features involving the games, such as texture pack or mod management.

The launcher uses the [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) framework, if you are interested in our motivation for _why_ see below.

## Usage

See the [documentation on our website](https://opengoal.dev/docs/usage/installation/) for hopefully up to date instructions on how to use it.

## Asking for help

When asking for help, please download the support package which includes logs to help someone diagnose the problem.

![](./docs/support-package.png)

If you cannot do this (for example, the bug relates to making the package / the application won't launch) then you can find the application logs in the following folders:

- Windows `C://Users/<YOUR_USER_NAME>/AppData/Roaming/OpenGOAL-Launcher/logs`
- Linux `/home/<YOUR_USER_NAME>/.config/OpenGOAL-Launcher/logs`

Note that both `AppData` and `.config` are hidden folders.

## Development

Tauri requires a valid Rust installation, as well as a valid NodeJS installation.

For installing Rust, it's recommended to follow the instructions here https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

### Windows

```bash
scoop install nodejs
npm install -g yarn
```

### Linux (Ubuntu 22.04)

```bash
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev build-essential curl wget libssl-dev libgtk-3-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev # tauri deps, see - https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites#setting-up-linux
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash # installs Node Version Manager (ubuntus package is woefully out of date)
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install lts/hydrogen # installs latest nodejs 18.X
npm install -g yarn
```

### Building and Running

To build and run the application locally, all you have to do is run:

```bash
yarn install
yarn tauri dev
```
